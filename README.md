# AP Computer Science A - Unit 2 Section 1

# Objects: Instances of Classes

This initial section of unit 2 is meant to delve into some important concepts about the organization of Java to continue building our core knowledge.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- Classes
- Objects
- Relationships Between Classes and Objects

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.
